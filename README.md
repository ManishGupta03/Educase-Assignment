## Implementation Details

### Sign-in Page

The sign-in page allows users to enter their credentials (e.g., email and password) to log in to the system. It includes form validation to ensure the entered data is correct.

### Sign-up Page

The sign-up page allows new users to create an account by providing necessary information such as name, email, and password. Form validation is also implemented here to validate user inputs.

### Dashboard

After successful sign-in or sign-up, users are redirected to the dashboard where they can view their profile information or perform other actions depending on the application's requirements.

### Rendering Form Data in Dashboard

The entered form data is stored in the component state upon submission. When redirected to the dashboard, this data is retrieved from the state and rendered accordingly.
